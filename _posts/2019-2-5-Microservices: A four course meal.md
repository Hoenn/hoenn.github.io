Creating an example microservice system first hand

## About
The idea behind this set of articles is to explore the _basics_ of writing a small handful of microservices that can be built upon to explore various topics like [rpc](https://microservices.io/patterns/communication-style/rpi.html), [event-sourcing](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/event-sourcing.html), [instrumentation](https://microservices.io/patterns/observability/application-metrics.html) and the like. The implementation details will be light but they will hopefully employ powerful real world technology. 

The code for the project lives on [github](https://github.com/Hoenn/mcrosvc)

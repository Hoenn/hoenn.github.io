## Examples aligning text and images

![image-left](/assets/images/my-img.png){: .align-left} You can left align images by adding `{: .align-left}` after you create your typical image mark down. This is some useless text to hopefully make it clear just how left aligned that bad boy is.

![image-center](/assets/images/my-img.png){: .align-center}
This is centered using `{: .align-center}`

<figure style="width: 100px" class="align-left">
  <img src="/assets/images/my-img.png" alt="">
  <figcaption>Itty-bitty caption.</figcaption>
</figure> 
If you feel like getting a little more funky you can embed some html into your markdown file using `figure` tags and a `figcaption` which gives off a better presentation of text wrap. This is some useless text to hopefully make it clear just how funky that bad boy is.

## Hello World
```console
hoenn@xu:~$ whoami
hoenn 

hoenn@xu:~$ cat ~/.aboutme
I'm a software engineer by day. I get to work on distributed systems

at work using some great technology

like go, kubernetes, kafka, ...

But it's nice to take a step back from worrying about clients

and scale and pagerduty. I'd like to share some of the personal

projects I'm working on that re-energize my programming roots and

have a go at technical writing as well.
